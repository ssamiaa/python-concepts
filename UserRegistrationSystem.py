#Objective: Simulate a user registration system that handles input errors using exceptions.
# Custom exception classes
class InvalidUsernameError(Exception):

class UnderageError(Exception):
    pass

class InvalidEmailError(Exception):
    pass

# --- Username Validation ---

# --- Age Validation ---
try:

# --- Email Validation ---

# --- Final Check ---
