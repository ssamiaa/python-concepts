# Python Concepts Practice

This repository contains hands-on Python programs developed as part of an internship training focused on mastering core Python programming concepts. The exercises progress from basic syntax and logic to object-oriented programming and file handling.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### 1. Dictionaries & Loops

**Student Subject Report**

* Nested dictionary for student marks
* Student-wise average
* Subject-wise toppers
* Overall topper

### 2. String Handling & Frequency Analysis

**Word Frequency Counter**

* Take input sentence
* Convert to lowercase
* Count word frequency
* Sort and display from highest to lowest

### 3. Conditional Statements & Functions

**ATM Simulation**

* Check balance, deposit, withdraw, exit
* Menu loop using conditionals
* Password authentication with 3 attempts

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Student Record System**

* Class with constructor and instance variables
* Usage of `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`

**Employee Management System**

* Class and instance variables
* `display()`, `change_company()`, and `is_salary_high()` methods

### 5. Inheritance & Polymorphism

**Online Payment System**

* Base class `PaymentMethod` with `pay()` and `payment_type()` methods
* Subclasses: `CreditCard`, `UPI`, `NetBanking`
* Method overriding to simulate real-world payment behavior
* `process_payment()` function demonstrating polymorphism

### 6. Exception Handling

**User Registration Validator**

* Input validation for username, age, and email
* Custom exceptions for invalid input
* Use of `try-except` blocks with both built-in and user-defined exceptions

### 7. File Handling

**Student Grades File Manager**

* Append student name and grade to `grades.txt`
* View all student records
* Search for a student by name using file operations

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

* Practice basic Python syntax and logic
* Use conditionals, loops, and functions effectively
* Work with strings, dictionaries, and files
* Understand and implement OOP principles: classes, inheritance, polymorphism
* Apply exception handling for robust programs
* Use file I/O to manage data persistently

## ðŸ”– How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run any script using:

```bash
python filename.py
```
