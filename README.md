# Python Concepts Practice

This repository contains hands-on Python programs developed as part of an internship training focused on mastering Python programming concepts. The exercises progress from basic syntax and conditionals to object-oriented programming (OOP).

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Dictionaries & Loops

- **Student Subject Report**
  - Nested dictionary for student marks
  - Student-wise average
  - Subject-wise toppers
  - Overall topper

### 2. String Handling & Frequency Analysis

- **Word Frequency Counter**
  - Take input sentence
  - Convert to lowercase
  - Count word frequency
  - Sort and display from highest to lowest

### 3. Conditional Statements & Functions

- **ATM Simulation**
  - Check balance, deposit, withdraw, exit
  - Menu loop using conditionals
  - Password authentication with 3 attempts

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Student Record System**
  - Class with constructor, instance variables
  - `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` usage

- **Employee Management System**
  - Class and instance variables
  - `display()`, `change_company()`, and `is_salary_high()` methods

### 5. Inheritance & Polymorphism

- **Online Payment System**
  - Base class `PaymentMethod` with `pay()` and `payment_type()` methods
  - Subclasses: `CreditCard`, `UPI`, `NetBanking`
  - Method overriding to simulate real-world payment behavior
  - `process_payment()` function demonstrating polymorphism

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Practice basic Python syntax and logic
- Use functions and conditionals effectively
- Work with dictionaries and strings
- Understand and implement OOP concepts: classes, static/class methods, inheritance, and polymorphism
